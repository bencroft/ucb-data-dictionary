As a proof of concept, the book serves as a demonstration of what University of Colorado Boulder may adopt as open, collaborative, and living documentation of data, data sets, and data applications. This proof of concept is version-controlled with Git, which enables version history, cross-team development, and rapid development. Additionally, this book can be hosted within Github Pages for public - or private - sharing among the campus system. Finally, this book can also be downloaded as a PDF, Ebook, or LaTeX file using the buttons at the top of this page. 1.1 Prerequisites Since this data dictionary is written in Markdown, it can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Where does the Student Success Data Mart source its data from?", " Chapter 2 Overview The Student Success Data Mart provides the ability to review and manage analytics such as enrollment and registration metrics, count of student and faculty by registered courses, available courses for catalog building and schedule building, graduation rates and student career fulfillment of requirements, student academic standing, and faculty and student profiles. Enrollment reports may include areas such as monitoring average class sizes, prerequisites not being met, grade distributions, and graduation eligibility. Reports in this category can also include aggregated statistical reports with year-to-year comparisons in several subject areas. With the Student Success Data Mart you can answer questions such as: 1) What are the enrollment metrics for this term? 2) Can I get the Student Retention and Graduation rates year over year by Cohort, Gender and Ethnicity? 3) What is average GPA by Institution, Career and Program? 4) What is average time to graduate by Institution, Career and Program? 5) What classes are scheduled for this term? 6) Can I track and analyze the workload of the faculty? 7) What are the Class enrollment details? 8) What are the honors/awards details for the enrolled students? 2.1 Where does the Student Success Data Mart source its data from? Student Records Data Mart is related to the Academic Program Activation and Management business process. This business process includes Course Catalog, Class Scheduling, Student Career Term records and Enrollment business processes. These processes fulfill the institutions need to track course delivery, student participation through enrollments to those classes. The Academic Program activation and Management processes help manage class size, a student’s enrollment in a class and track the resulting grades from the class.

Each row of this table contains the most current information about an individual student and a particular academic plan. This fact table also contains all students that enrolled, matriculated, withdrew, or completed the academic career/program and plan in the institution. The table is not keyed by term. Institution, Career, and Program are indirectly part of the key since they are derived from the Academic Plan dimension. There is one row of data per student (person) academic plan surrogate ID and student career number. Records are updated frequently, whenever the student program status changed. This may include status changes from activated, admitted, discontinued, or completed. 3.2 Helps Answer This star may help answer the following: Number of enrollments by program or plan. Number of students who dropped out. Number of students in different program actions (statuses) and program action reasons by career, program, or plan. Number of students that completed the program/plan. Number of students that cancelled the program/plan. 3.3 Star Links This star can be built from F_ACADPLAN_SUMM and connects to the following tables: Table 3.1: A table generated by the longtable package. matrix.input..ncol…1..byrow…T.

The star provides term statistics and cumulative statistics by term, student, institution, and career. This star also provides measures such as units-in-progress, GPA, number of courses enrolled, etc. Institution and Career are indirectly part of the key since they are deirved from the Term surrogate ID. There is one row of data per term surrogate ID and student. 4.2 Helps Answer This star may help answer the following: Top student academic standings. Nmber of units in progress vs. passed by institution, career, program, or plan. Average number of courses a student takes per term, by career, program, or plan. Number of units a student is enrolled in. Number of full time and part time students by term, institution, campus, primary program, etc. Number of students taking GPA units.
