As a proof of concept, the book serves as a demonstration of what University of Colorado Boulder may adopt as open, collaborative, and living documentation of data, data sets, and data applications. This proof of concept is version-controlled with Git, which enables version history, cross-team development, and rapid development. Additionally, this book can be hosted within Github Pages for public - or private - sharing among the campus system. Finally, this book can also be downloaded as a PDF, Ebook, or LaTeX file using the buttons at the top of this page. 1.1 Prerequisites Since this data dictionary is written in Markdown, it can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.

Enrollment reports may include areas such as monitoring average class sizes, prerequisites not being met, grade distributions, and graduation eligibility. Reports in this category can also include aggregated statistical reports with year-to-year comparisons in several subject areas. With the Student Success Data Mart you can answer questions such as: 1) What are the enrollment metrics for this term? 2) Can I get the Student Retention and Graduation rates year over year by Cohort, Gender and Ethnicity? 3) What is average GPA by Institution, Career and Program? 4) What is average time to graduate by Institution, Career and Program? 5) What classes are scheduled for this term? 6) Can I track and analyze the workload of the faculty? 7) What are the Class enrollment details? 8) What are the honors/awards details for the enrolled students? 2.1 Where does the Student Success Data Mart source its data from? Student Records Data Mart is related to the Academic Program Activation and Management business process. This business process includes Course Catalog, Class Scheduling, Student Career Term records and Enrollment business processes. These processes fulfill the institutions need to track course delivery, student participation through enrollments to those classes. The Academic Program activation and Management processes help manage class size, a student’s enrollment in a class and track the resulting grades from the class.

Each row of this table contains the most current information about an individual student and a particular academic plan. This fact table also contains all students that enrolled, matriculated, withdrew, or completed the academic career/program and plan in the institution. The table is not keyed by term. Institution, Career, and Program are indirectly part of the key since they are derived from the Academic Plan dimension. There is one row of data per student (person) academic plan surrogate ID and student career number. Records are updated frequently, whenever the student program status changed. This may include status changes from activated, admitted, discontinued, or completed. 3.2 Helps Answer This star may help answer the following: Number of enrollments by program or plan. Number of students who dropped out. Number of students in different program actions (statuses) and program action reasons by career, program, or plan. Number of students that completed the program/plan. Number of students that cancelled the program/plan. 3.3 Star Links This star can be built from F_ACADPLAN_SUMM and connects to the following tables: Table 3.1: A table generated by the longtable package. matrix.input..ncol…1..byrow…T.

Example Values 5.22 Class Section - “regular” lecture section Source: Date Revised: Definition A course which is provided principally by means of regularly scheduled classes meeting in classrooms or similar facilities at stated times. Example Values 5.23 Class Section - “regular” lecture section Source: Date Revised: Definition For reporting departmental information (Quarterly Census; End of Year Academic Analysis/Faculty Load), “regular or organized” sections are identified any section that counts toward faculty load and is not identified as individual instruction. When counting credits generated for faculty load purposes, overload classes are not included as part of “regular” credits. Example Values 5.24 Class Section - blended/hybrid instruction Source: Date Revised: Definition Course that blends online and face-to-face delivery. Substantial portion of the content is delivered online, typically uses online discussions, and typically has some face-to-face meetings. (Portion of content delivered online: 30 to 79%.) Schedule code BRL identifies these classes. For general discussion of schedule coding scheme, see “Class Section - Schedule Type - Coding Scheme.” Example Values 5.25 Class Section - Individual Instruction Source: Date Revised: Definition In an Individual Instruction class, the student does specific work independently with the instructor as outlined in the official Independent Study Agreement. Work for an independent study occurs outside of the classroom setting. The instructor and student must meet on a regular basis for the number of consultations noted in the agreement. Courses are defined as individual instruction if they fall into one of the following types: Independent Study, Internship, Practicum (not Clinical Practicum), Research, Thesis, Colloquium, Special Topics, Individual Instruction, Dissertation. For reporting departmental information (Quarterly Census; End of Year Academic Analysis), sections with a SSBSECT_SCHD_CODE of 1-character codes 5, 6, 7, 8, E, F, M, V, W and 3-character codes 2IN, 5IN, 7IL, 7IN, 8IN, EIL, HIN, JIL, JIN, MIL, MIN, NIL, OIL, RIN, VIN are considered individual instruction sections.

(Portion of content delivered online: 80% or more.) Example Values 5.29 Class Section - Schedule Type-Coding Scheme Source: Date Revised: Definition For reporting purposes OIR uses a revised schedule type coding scheme. OIR moved from a 1 character code to a 3 character code.
